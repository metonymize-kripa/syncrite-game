            <h2>White Paper: Ecological and Ritual-Based Game Simulation</h2>
        
            <h3>1. Concept Overview</h3>
            <p>
                This simulation game is inspired by ethnographic and ecological research, notably Roy Rappaport's work in <em>Pigs for the Ancestors</em> and recent developments in collective behavior modeling, such as those presented by Tao Gao in the <em>Imagined We: Stag Hunting</em> paper. Our goal is to create a game that simulates the intricate interactions between human societies, their ecological environment, and spiritual beliefs. 
                The simulation aims to explore how ritual practices, resource management, and environmental feedback loops shape and sustain societies, and how breakdowns in cooperation or ritual failure can lead to societal collapse or ecological degradation.
            </p>
        
            <h3>2. Approach</h3>
            <p>
                The core mechanics of the game center on managing resources (human populations, pigs, yams) and performing rituals to maintain or increase favor with spiritual entities (gods). These interactions are modeled as a dynamic system where time progresses, and the player must balance short-term survival needs (food, resources) with long-term spiritual and ecological stability.
            </p>
            
            <h4>2.1 Entities and Resources</h4>
            <p>
                The simulation involves key ecological and agential entities:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Humans:</strong> The population consumes yams as a food source and participates in rituals. They are the main agents in the system, managing both resources and spiritual obligations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pigs:</strong> Pigs serve a dual role, acting as a food source and being sacrificed in rituals to please the gods. The size of the pig population impacts both the ecological balance and the ability to perform certain rituals.</li>
                    <li><strong>Yams:</strong> Yams are the primary resource for human survival. Their growth is influenced by environmental conditions and spiritual favor. Overexploitation can lead to famine and population decline.</li>
                    <li><strong>Gods/Spiritual Entities:</strong> The gods are abstract entities representing the society's spiritual connection to the natural world. Their favor fluctuates based on ritual performance, which in turn affects the ecosystem (e.g., yam growth, weather conditions).</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        
            <h4>2.2 Rituals and Cooperation</h4>
            <p>
                Rituals play a central role in the simulation. They are collective actions that require the sacrifice of pigs and participation by the human population. Successful rituals increase the favor of the gods, which results in positive environmental effects such as better yam harvests. However, the success of these rituals depends on group cooperation: if not enough resources or participants are involved, the ritual may fail, leading to negative consequences such as resource depletion or a loss of favor.
            </p>
            <p>
                Drawing from concepts in Tao Gaoâ€™s <em>Imagined We: Stag Hunting</em>, the game models how individual agents must balance their own needs with those of the collective. Rituals, like hunting in the stag-hunt scenario, require collective cooperation for optimal outcomes. Agents will act under conditions of uncertainty, making decisions based on their belief systems, prior experiences, and perceived benefits.
            </p>
        
            <h4>2.3 Dynamic Systems and Feedback Loops</h4>
            <p>
                Time progression and feedback loops are essential to the simulation. As the game progresses, human populations consume yams, pigs reproduce (but can also be depleted through sacrifices), and rituals either succeed or fail based on player decisions. The favor of the gods dynamically influences the environment, such as by enhancing or diminishing yam fertility, creating a feedback loop between spiritual practices and resource availability.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over time, mismanagement of resources or failed rituals can lead to ecological collapse, famine, and population decline. Conversely, effective resource management and successful rituals can lead to abundance and societal prosperity. The challenge for the player is to find a balance between consumption, spiritual duties, and long-term survival.
            </p>
        
            <h3>3. Motivation and Future Directions</h3>
            <p>
                The motivation behind this game is to explore the intricate relationship between ecology, spirituality, and human society, as studied in ethnographic research. By modeling these relationships in a game format, we provide a way for players to engage with complex feedback systems and decision-making processes. This helps illustrate how cooperation, ritual observance, and ecological stewardship are interconnected in human societies.
            </p>
            <p>
                As the game develops, additional layers of complexity can be introduced, including:
                <ul>
                    <li>More sophisticated rituals that require a balance of different resources and agents.</li>
                    <li>Multiple spiritual entities, each influencing different aspects of the environment.</li>
                    <li>Individual agent behavior that factors in personal goals, cooperation, and trust dynamics.</li>
                    <li>Cultural evolution over time, with rituals and social structures adapting to ecological conditions.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                This minimal prototype serves as the foundation for future expansions, allowing for the gradual introduction of more complex ecological, social, and spiritual interactions. The goal is to offer a rich simulation experience that educates players on the complex dynamics of human societies and their reliance on both material resources and intangible beliefs.
